00:00:00.009 --> 00:00:03.209
- To a passport office or apply in the mail. And

00:00:03.220 --> 00:00:06.139
- it's important to remember that for Children under the age

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:09.890
- of 18, even if you've had a previous passport, it's

00:00:09.898 --> 00:00:12.060
- not considered a renewal. It's considered to be a new

00:00:12.069 --> 00:00:17.728
- application for security reasons and protection reasons for Children. But

00:00:17.739 --> 00:00:19.908
- if there's more details, then perhaps you can share them

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:24.440
- only to share that the online renewal application we anticipate

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:26.870
- will be available this fall and we expect it will

00:00:26.879 --> 00:00:29.548
- create advantages from processing time with the ability to upload

00:00:29.559 --> 00:00:32.609
- your passport directly for the purpose of the renewal. How

00:00:32.618 --> 00:00:34.439
- is this going to help you out at service Canada

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:37.240
- when you have situations with big lines and that sort

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:38.908
- of thing, are people going to see a difference in

00:00:38.918 --> 00:00:40.759
- the way that in the speed in which they're able

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:43.668
- to access their passports? Yes. So I think it's important

00:00:43.679 --> 00:00:47.069
- to note that service Canada is completely back within service

00:00:47.079 --> 00:00:50.348
- standards when it comes to issuing passports. But it was

00:00:50.359 --> 00:00:54.560
- one of the lessons learned from the experience last spring

00:00:54.569 --> 00:00:58.130
- and summer that we needed to modernize the passport.
