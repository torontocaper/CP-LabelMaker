## Quickly and easily create Audacity-friendly labels files using Slack

This app takes advantage of Slack's built-in transcription functionality to create a plain-text file that can be imported as "labels" into Audacity -- the free, open-source digital audio workstation (DAW).

Here's how it works. 

### Step 1 -- Acquire Audio

Record your audio in Audacity.

When you're finished, export the audio -- preferably as an mp3. 

(note: you can use audio from another source, as long as you import it into Audacity at some point.)

### Step 2 -- Upload Audio to Slack

As mentioned, this app takes advantage of Slack's built-in transcription service, so we need to get our audio into Slack. 

Luckily, this is as simple as sending a message with an attachment.

Now we're ready to invoke the app. 

### Step 3 -- React to your post with the "label" emoji (üè∑Ô∏è)

This sends a "POST" request the app's "Slack/Events" endpoint, triggering the actual label-making part.

After a few seconds or minutes (depending on the length of the file), you should get a response from the LabelMaker app.

At this point, you can download the "labels" file and bring it into Audacity.

### Step 4 -- Import your labels into Audacity

Now we bring our labels into Audacity so that our transcript lines up with our audio.

It's as simple as clicking File/Import/Labels... in the Audacity toolbar.

Hopefully this makes it easier to identify the parts of your audio you want to save.
