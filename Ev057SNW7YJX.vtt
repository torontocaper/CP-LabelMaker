00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:05.009
- Holders, but even still, you know, having that simpler renewal

00:00:05.019 --> 00:00:08.970
- process will make the whole flow easier. And just a

00:00:08.978 --> 00:00:12.228
- reminder that this July is the first anniversary of the

00:00:12.239 --> 00:00:16.388
- 1st 10 year passport applications. So we do anticipate that

00:00:16.399 --> 00:00:19.158
- over the coming 12 to 18 months, we're going to

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:22.199
- see a higher volume of renewals and we've already started

00:00:22.208 --> 00:00:24.138
- to see that in terms of the applications coming in.

00:00:24.149 --> 00:00:26.489
- So I think this is another great tool to add

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:30.298
- to our toolbox that will ensure a smooth and pleasant

00:00:30.309 --> 00:00:32.819
- experience for Canadians when they apply. Can you just remind

00:00:32.829 --> 00:00:35.598
- me quickly if you've run pilot projects on this and

00:00:35.609 --> 00:00:37.689
- whether there were any kinks that you kind of had

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:43.668
- to work out there, there have been pilot projects on

00:00:43.679 --> 00:00:48.399
- this. they've mostly been internal. And so the reason why

00:00:49.168 --> 00:00:51.810
- you know, there's a comfort in like we would never

00:00:51.819 --> 00:00:53.899
- launch this project publicly.
